# Graph Representation Learning via Ladder Gamma Variational Autoencoders

## Abstract
We present a probabilistic framework for community discov-ery and link prediction for graph-structured data, based on a novel, gamma ladder variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture. We model each node in the graph via a deep hierarchy of gamma-distributed embeddings, and define each link probability via a nonlinear function of the bottom-most layerâ€™s embeddings of its associated nodes. In addition to leveraging the representational power of multiple layers of stochastic variables via the ladder VAE architecture, our framework offers the following benefits: 
(1) Unlike existing ladder VAE architectures  based  on  real-valued  latent  variables, the  gamma-distributed latent variables naturally result in non-negativity and sparsity of the learned embeddings, and facilitate their direct interpretation as membership of nodes into (possibly multiple) communities/topics; (2) A novel recognition model for our gamma ladder VAE architecture allows fast inference of node embeddings; and 
(3) The framework also extends nat-urally to incorporate node side information (features and/orlabels). 
Our framework is also fairly modular and can leverage a wide variety of graph neural networks as the VAE encoder. We report both quantitative and qualitative results onseveral benchmark datasets and compare our model with several state-of-the-art methods.

## Example usage for edge-prediction:
python train.py --dataset cora --hidden 64_32 --use_kl_warmup 1 --epochs 500 --cosine_norm 1 --reconstruct_x 1

## Example usage for semisupervised node classification:
python train.py --dataset citeseer --hidden 64_32 --use_kl_warmup 1 --epochs 100  --weight_decay 5e-3 --semisup_train 1 --dropout 0.5 --reconstruct_x 1
