# Graph Representation Learning via Ladder Gamma Variational Autoencoders

## Abstract
We present a probabilistic framework for community discov-ery and link prediction for graph-structured data, based on anovel, gamma ladder variational autoencoder (VAE) architec-ture. We model each node in the graph via a deep hierarchy ofgamma-distributed embeddings, and define each link proba-bility via a nonlinear function of the bottom-most layerâ€™s em-beddings of its associated nodes. In addition to leveraging therepresentational power of multiple layers ofstochasticvari-ables via the ladder VAE architecture, our framework offersthe following benefits: (1) Unlike existing ladder VAE archi-tectures  based  on  real-valued  latent  variables,  the  gamma-distributed latent variables naturally result in non-negativityand sparsity of the learned embeddings, and facilitate theirdirect interpretation as membership of nodes into (possiblymultiple) communities/topics; (2) A novelrecognitionmodelfor our gamma ladder VAE architecture allows fast inferenceof node embeddings; and (3) The framework also extends nat-urally to incorporate node side information (features and/orlabels). Our framework is also fairly modular and can lever-age a wide variety of graph neural networks as the VAE en-coder. We report both quantitative and qualitative results onseveral benchmark datasets and compare our model with sev-eral state-of-the-art methods.

## Example usage for edge-prediction:
python train.py --dataset cora --hidden 64_32 --use_kl_warmup 1 --epochs 500 --cosine_norm 1 --reconstruct_x 1

## Example usage for semisupervised node classification:
python train.py --dataset citeseer --hidden 64_32 --use_kl_warmup 1 --epochs 100  --weight_decay 5e-3 --semisup_train 1 --dropout 0.5 --reconstruct_x 1
